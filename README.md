# Welcome to my AAC Code Challenge

This project was created in response to a code challenge I recieved. Please keep reading to understand how to run the project locally!

## Requirements

This project was written with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version `16.14.2`. I recommend installing and using this version to run the project.

## Getting Started

First you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. Then complete the following steps.

```bash
# Install dependencies, none to speak of at the moment...
~$ yarn

# Run the local dev server
~$ yarn start

```
